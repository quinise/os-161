OS/161
==============================

My os161 repository holds a modified kernel inside OS/161 that I modified. I wrote an additional test and saved it in "test" directory to the test menu called printmessage. That program accepts the pm command line argument from the console and prints its message. The program also spawns another thread and print its thread name.
